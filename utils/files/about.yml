intro:  "#### Design is more than just aesthetics; it is the creation of meaningful and memorable experiences that resonate with the users. Designers draw inspiration from the nuances and insights of everyday life and translate them into their work and user interactions. The impact of design is not only visual, but also emotional, cognitive and behavioral. It depends on how well the designers craft their stories and how deeply they connect with the users' memories and choices."
