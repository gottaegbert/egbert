aboutShort: Hi ðŸ‘‹, I am a designer and a web developer with a passion for creating engaging and user-friendly digital products. I have experience in UX/UI design, web development and game design, and I enjoy applying my skills to various domains and challenges. I am currently pursuing an MSc degree in Digital and Interaction Design at Politecnico di Milano, where I am learning new techniques and tools to enhance my design thinking and practice. My goal is to structure the digital world in a way that makes it more accessible, enjoyable and meaningful for everyone.
