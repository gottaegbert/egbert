          This is a project from "Envision A.I. through design" class.The aim of the project was to design a supportive dashboard for the manager of the British Museum to facilitate decision-making with the help of Artificial Intelligence. By combining data from the British Museum, digital initiatives and data concerning the Covid-19 pandemic, the system aims to support the strategic operation of the museum. It assists the Manager, the financial department and the marketing department by predicting future developments of the museum, highlighting potential target groups and giving inspiration for content delivery. Furthermore, by exploiting visitors' reviews from TripAdvisor and Twitter, the system collects and visualises the audience's opinions and demographics – helping the British Museum improve its targeting and provide greater value for a greater audience.

          This is a project from "Digital Art" class. It has a website demo you can check [here](https://gottaegbert.github.io/Mondrian-s-Mac/). We know that Mondrian’s artwork has gone through tranmandous changes through his life time. We want to explore the contexts of his creation process and his real life behind extraordinary artworks. 
          We want to seek a mirror that allows us to dip into the life unseen to us. So we can’t help to think
          if Mondrian has a Mac, what will it be like?

          If the chameleon-like AI is gradually becoming conscious, how would it think about its history? How do we humans feel about them? “AI mirror”, an interac- tive art, tends to visualize the self-knowledge mechanism from the AI’s perspec- tive and arouses people’s reflection on artificial intelligence.
          Imagine when you look at yourself, the self image illustration you obtain, is it really complete and divergent enough? Here, with the assistance of artificial intelligence, we look into every pixel sensed from you and find those undiscovered traits of yourself by doing generative art, then have some reflections and write lines of poetry for you.

Thus those who don't know the sports can get knowledge and those knowledgeable can make further exploration.

  #         To do so we created an extra react component library.

  #         The mobile app and the websites were built in a monorepo using respectively

  #         In order to also share the components across the websites we built a component library using React and Storybook.


  #         Each one of the two website is divided into two main sections: a brochure section and a dashboard section.


  #         The first one is almost entirely stateless, backend driven, and server side rendered. The dashboard is the section of the website where the user can interact with STC services and is client side rendered.

  #         The interactive map displays the predicted fishing probability (FP) by zone and species for the next week, on a scale from zero to one. This variable represents how easy it will be to fish a species in a precise spot. Zero is assigned to areas where it will be more difficult to find and fish a species, while one to an area where it will be easier on a given day.
  #     - body: I worked closely with the data scientists to design and develop the interface of the webapp and its architecture. The goal was to deliver a simple and intuitive way to display their data without crowding the interface with too much information but still being useful to the end user.

These files are then exposed at three different domains to improve performance. The front end then uses mapbox-gl-js to consume and render the .pbf files.
      

  #     The webapp is developed in the form of a PWA (progressive web app) so that it can be easily installed and accessed."
