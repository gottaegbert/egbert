          This is a project from "Envision A.I. through design" class.The aim of the project was to design a supportive dashboard for the manager of the British Museum to facilitate decision-making with the help of Artificial Intelligence. By combining data from the British Museum, digital initiatives and data concerning the Covid-19 pandemic, the system aims to support the strategic operation of the museum. It assists the Manager, the financial department and the marketing department by predicting future developments of the museum, highlighting potential target groups and giving inspiration for content delivery. Furthermore, by exploiting visitors' reviews from TripAdvisor and Twitter, the system collects and visualises the audience's opinions and demographics – helping the British Museum improve its targeting and provide greater value for a greater audience.

  #         The newly desigend DLS needed to be translated into code and implemented
  #         across three different touchpoints. A mobile app and two websites (one B2B and one B2C).
  #         To do so we created an extra react component library.
  #     - category: My role
  #       body:
  #         In a team made mostly of contractors, I was the only in house front-end
  #         developer working on the websites. As such I was in charge of
  #         enforcing best practices, writing code and code reviews, and be the link between developers and designers.
  #     - category: Architecture
  #       body: >-
  #         The mobile app and the websites were built in a monorepo using respectively
  #         react native and react.js so that they could share most of the logic,
  #         hooks, state management, types, epics etc..


  #         In order to also share the components across the websites we built a component library using React and Storybook.


  #         Each one of the two website is divided into two main sections: a brochure section and a dashboard section.


  #         The first one is almost entirely stateless, backend driven, and server side rendered. The dashboard is the section of the website where the user can interact with STC services and is client side rendered.

  #         The interactive map displays the predicted fishing probability (FP) by zone and species for the next week, on a scale from zero to one. This variable represents how easy it will be to fish a species in a precise spot. Zero is assigned to areas where it will be more difficult to find and fish a species, while one to an area where it will be easier on a given day.
  #     - body: I worked closely with the data scientists to design and develop the interface of the webapp and its architecture. The goal was to deliver a simple and intuitive way to display their data without crowding the interface with too much information but still being useful to the end user.

  #     - body: "The data produced by the model (running on the company server) get pushed every week on a AWS S3 bucket in the form of .pbf files. These files are then exposed at three different domains to improve performance. The front end then uses mapbox-gl-js to consume and render the .pbf files.
      

  #     The webapp is developed in the form of a PWA (progressive web app) so that it can be easily installed and accessed."
